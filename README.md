# Quantum-Counselor-for-stock-investment-
The Quantum Counselor for portfolio investment is a tool with two main objectives: forecasting the trend of assets price and optimizing portfolio returns both using quantum computing techniques. For the case of the forecasting method, we use a hybrid method that combines a deep learning model of classical LSTM layers with quantum layers. For the case of portfolio optimization, the quantum algorithms of QAOA and VQE are used to solve the problem and will be compared with CPLEX, a classical solver. Both tools are deeply connected because the forecasted price of the different assets is used for the cost function construction.
